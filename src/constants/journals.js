    title: 'A molecular mechanism of chronological aging in yeast',
    authors: 'Burtner',
    species: 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae',
    summary: 'Aging under standard culture conditions is the result of a cell-extrinsic component that is linked to the pH of the culture medium. Identify acetic acid as a cell-extrinsic mediator of cell death during chronological aging, and demonstrate that dietary restriction, growth in a non-fermentable carbon source, or transferring cells to water increases chronological life span by reducing or eliminating extracellular acetic acid. Other life span extending environmental and genetic interventions, such as growth in high osmolarity media, deletion of SCH9 or RAS2, increase cellular resistance to acetic acid.',

    summary: 'Chronologically aged yeast cultures die exhibiting typical markers of apoptosis, accumulate oxygen radicals, and show caspase activation. Age-induced cell death is strongly delayed by overexpressing YAP1, a key transcriptional regulator in oxygen stress response. Disruption of apoptosis through deletion of yeast caspase YCA1 initially results in better survival of aged cultures. However, surviving cells lose the ability of regrowth, indicating that pre damaged cells accumulate in the absence of apoptotic cell removal.',

    summary: 'To prove that OPTMs of SirT1 are glutathione (GSH) adducts, glutaredoxin-1 was overexpressed to remove this modification. Glutaredoxin-1 overexpression maintained endogenous SirT1 activity and prevented proapoptotic signaling in metabolically stressed HepG2 cells. The in vivo significance of oxidative inactivation of SirT1 was investigated in livers of high fat diet-fed C57/B6J mice. SirT1 deacetylase activity was decreased in the absence of changes in SirT1 expression and associated with a marked increase in OPTMs. These results indicate that glutathione adducts on specific SirT1 thiols may be responsible for dysfunctional SirT1 associated with liver disease in metabolic syndrome.',

The continuous presence of glucose is not necessary for the induction of growth events, but rather a short \'pulse\' of glucose followed by an incubation period in water will induce growth events. Growth stimulation by glucose occurs in the absence of the SNF3 high affinity glucose transporter growth stimulation occurs independent of carbon source phosphorylation and carbon source metabolism growth induction by carbon source does not require protein synthesis or extracellular calcium. Sixth, following stimulation by carbon source, the cells remain induced for more than 2 h after removal of the carbon source.',

The Pkc1 pathway does not regulate the TOR proteins: transcriptional changes dependent on inhibition of the TORs occur normally in pkc1Delta and mpk1Delta mutants when starved for nitrogen; pkc1Delta and mpk1Delta mutants die rapidly upon treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the TORs. We find that Mpk1 is transiently activated by rapamycin treatment via a novel mechanism. Finally, we find that rapamycin treatment or nitrogen starvation induces resistance to the cell wall-digesting enzyme zymolyase by a Pkc1-dependent mechanism. Thus, the Pkc1 pathway is not a nutrient sensor but acts downstream of TOR inhibition to maintain cell integrity in quiescence.',

Studies in worms and flies point to secondary hormones as mediators of the effect of insulin/ IGF-1 signaling on longevity, whereas studies in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that glucose or insulin/ IGF-1 may decrease longevity by directly down-regulating stress resistance genes. In yeast, longevity mutations postpone superoxide toxicity and mitochondrial damage. However, the small life span extension caused by the overexpression of superoxide dismutases and catalase in yeast and flies indicates that increased antioxidant protection alone cannot be responsible for the major life span extension caused by signal transduction mutations.',

    species: 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae',
    summary: 'By using a mutant unable to synthesize trehalose and glycogen, we have investigated this requirement of trehalose and glycogen under carbon-limited conditions in continuous cultures. Trehalose and glycogen levels increased with decreasing growth rates in the wild-type strain, whereas no trehalose or glycogen was detected in the mutant. However, the mutant was still able to grow and divide at low growth rates with doubling times similar to those for the wild-type strain, indicating that trehalose and glycogen are not essential for cell cycle progression. Nevertheless, upon a slight increase of extracellular carbohydrates, the wild-type strain degraded its reserve carbohydrates and was able to enter a cell division cycle faster than the mutant. In addition, wild-type cells survived much longer than the mutant cells when extracellular carbon was exhausted. Thus, trehalose and glycogen have a dual role under these conditions, serving as storage factors during carbon starvation and providing quickly a higher carbon and ATP flux when conditions improve. Interestingly, the CO2 production rate and hence the ATP flux were higher in the mutant than in the wild-type strain at low growth rates.',

    authors: 'Lin H1, Castro NM, Bennett GN, San KY.',
    species: 'Escherichia coli ',
    summary: 'The overexpression of acetyl-CoA (CoA) synthetase (ACS) in Escherichia coli showed significant reduction in acetate during glucose fermentation. It also greatly enhanced acetate assimilation when acetate was used as a carbon source. These features are ideal for applications in metabolic engineering. ACS overexpression can be strategically applied to reduce acetate byproduct, recover wasted carbon, and redirect carbon flux toward more favorable pathways. The native acs gene was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. Studies showed significant effects on acetate production and assimilation in cultures grown in minimal and complex media with glucose or acetate as the carbon source.',

    summary: 'The light intensity and acetate concentration were selected as major factors affecting the algal growth rate. The first factorial design (22) was performed with the light levels of 80–120 μE m−2 s−1 and 40–70 mM acetate. As a result, the optimum conditions were not present within the domain of the first experimental design. An ascent line obtained from the first design showed that the optimum conditions existed within a region of lower concentration of acetate, but similar intensity of light. On the basis of the ascent line, additional experiments were carried out using a central composite design, which enhanced the growth rate up to 0.243 g L−1 day−1 at a light intensity of 170 μE m−2 s−1 and acetate concentration of 30 mM.',

    summary: 'The presence of acetate led to a variation of growth parameters μmax, Iopt and β. The effect of acetate gradient on the growth of the microalga was severe as soon as its concentration in the medium was higher. The acetate uptake followed a Michaelis–Menten kinetic in the light as well as in the dark. The capacity of assimilation was slightly higher in the dark. The utilization of DNP and DCMU indicates that acetate incorporation is an active process depending on both anabolic (photosynthesis) and catabolic (respiration) metabolisms, corroborating the model of the Michaelis–Menten kinetic.',

    species: 'Scenedesmus obliquus',
    summary: 'The effect of acetate on growth and rate of ammonium uptake in Scenedesmus obliquus (UTEX 78) was investigated under light‐limiting conditions. Addition of acetate to autotrophic cells with a growth constant of 0.71 day−1 resulted in an increase in the growth rate (mixotrophy, k = 1.3 day−1), and in the presence of acetate, growth occurred in the dark (heterophy, k = 0.44 day−1). The rate of ammonium uptake in autotrophy (17.8 amol cell−1 min−1) was similar to that in heterotrophy (17.4 amol cell−1 min−1) but was 3.7 times lower than that in mixotrophy (65.9 amol cell−1 min−1). In general, mixotrophic cells showed optimum ammonium uptake at the acetate concentration at which they were grown. In autotrophy, uptake of ammonium leveled off at about 12.5 μM while no saturation was observed in mixotrophic cells. An increase in the rate of uptake of ammonium was observed in autotrophic cells within 1 h after the addition of acetate. The activity of isocitrate lyase (EC 4.1.3.1), a key enzyme for the regulation of the glyoxylate cycle responsible for acetate catabolism, showed a 3.9‐fold increase in activity after 24 h in the dark in the presence of acetate. The level of isocitrate lyase activity in cells grown for 24 h in the dark in the presence of 0–20 mM acetate also increased as a function of acetate concentration.',

The photosynthetic pigments were degraded, gross photosynthesis and respiration disappeared gradually, and DNA fragmentation was also detected. Those results indicated that C. reinhardtii cells underwent a PCD but not a necrotic, accidental cell death event. It was noticed that C. reinhardtii cells in PCD released abundant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) upon acetic acid stress. Therefore, we analyzed the VOCs and tested their effects on other normal cells. The treatment of C. reinhardtii cultures with VOCs reduced the cell density and increased antioxidant enzyme activity. Therefore, a function of VOCs as infochemicals involved in cell-to-cell communication at the conditions of applied stress is suggested',

Physiological analyses highlight the importance of photosynthesis for the low-acetate and exponential-phase samples. The stationary phase is reached when acetate is depleted, except for the cells grown at 57 mM acetate, which still divide until ammonium exhaustion.',

    summary: 'No inhibition by acetate was observed at low concentrations (≤ 0·4 g/litre), in which case, cell growth was well described by the Monod model. However, above this acetate concentration, growth was progressively inhibited. Inhibition was observed as a decrease in both the specific growth rate and the observed growth yield. The former was well modelled using the Haldane Model. A model based on constant qm was proposed to describe the latter phenomenon. Whereas it predicted the trend of falling observed cell growth yield with initial acetate concentration in batch cultures, there was significant lack of fit between simulated and experimental data. In continuous cultures, a steady state cell concentration of 0·4 g/litre and maximum cell productivity of 0·02 g/litre/h was obtained for an acetate feed concentration of 0·85 g/litre. This compares well with values achieved by photosynthetic mass culture systems.',

    summary: 'Results suggest that exogenous acetate feeds into a modified tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which bypasses the CO2 evolution steps, explaining increases in biomass, consistent with experimental data. In addition, reactions of the oxidative pentose phosphate and glycolysis pathways, inactive under phototrophic conditions, show substantial flux under mixotrophic conditions. Importantly, acetate addition leads to an increased flux through cyclic electron flow (CEF), but results in a repression of CO2 fixation via Rubisco, explaining the down regulation of photosynthesis. However, although CEF enhances growth on acetate, it is not essential—impairment of CEF results in alternative metabolic pathways being increased.',

In short-term treatments, significant amounts of oil were found to be accumulated concomitantly with starch only under conditions of N starvation, as expected, or in cells cultured with high acetate in otherwise standard growth medium. Time-course analysis revealed that oil accumulation under N starvation lags behind that of starch and rapid oil synthesis occurs only when carbon supply exceeds the capacity of starch synthesis. In the starchless mutant BAFJ5, blocking starch synthesis results in significant increases in the extent and rate of oil accumulation. In the parental strain, but not the starchless mutant, oil accumulation under N starvation was strictly dependent on the available external acetate supply and the amount of oil increased steadily as the acetate concentration increased to the levels several-fold higher than that of the standard growth medium.',

    summary: 'Mixotrophic growth in acetate is not associated with activation of the cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase pathway. The fraction of carbon biomass resulting from photosynthesis, determined by stable carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry, declined dramatically (about 50%) in cells grown in acetate with saturating light and CO2. Under these conditions, photosynthetic CO2 fixation and O2 evolution were also reduced by about 50%. Some growth conditions (e.g. limiting light, high acetate, solid medium in air) virtually abolished photosynthetic carbon gain. These effects of acetate were exacerbated in mutants with slowed electron transfer through the D1 reaction center protein of photosystem II or impaired chloroplast protein synthesis. Therefore, in mixotrophic fully grown cells of C. reinhardtii, interpretations of the effects of environmental or genetic manipulations of photosynthesis are likely to be confounded by acetate in the medium.',

Acetate down-regulates the capacity of the Calvin cycle and promotes its own uptake and storage to counteract the osmotic stress associated with high extracellular acetate concentrations. Acetate stimulates mitochondrial respiration by heightening the intracellular reductant content and the capacity of the cytochrome pathway. Acetate inhibits NPQ through repression of the LHCSR3-dependent qE component Mitochondrial respiration contributes to provide nitrate assimilation with reductant through the acetate-dependent activity of AOX',

Carrying out the analysis on groups of dark and light phase samples separately allows identifying constraints and gene pathways that discriminate between mutant and control samples. Carbon metabolism is the most important in the light phase for the control strain while the dark phase is enriched in cell division pathways. The mutant phenotype includes genes pathways of stress response and autophagy in the two phases. Cell division pathways are found in the light phase and catabolic pathways in the dark phase, highlighting a rewiring of the mutant transcriptome in these cyclic cultivation conditions.',

The sequence of events leading to the photoevolution of H2 from acetate includes the conversion of acetate into succinate via the extraplastidic glyoxylate cycle, the oxidation of succinate to fumarate by chloroplastic succinate dehydrogenase, and the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate in the chloroplast by NAD dependent malate dehydrogenase. The level of potential activity for the enzymes assayed were sufficient to accommodate the observed rate of the photoanaerobic dissimilation of acetate and the photoevolution of H2.',

    summary: 'When photosynthetic linear and cyclic electron flows are blocked (DCMU inhibiting PSII and methylviologen accepting electrons from PSI), the post-illumination reduction kinetics of P700+ directly reflect the dark metabolic production of reductants (mainly NAD(P)H) in the stroma of chloroplasts. Such results can be correlated to other metabolic studies: in the absence of acetate, for example, the P700+ reduction rate matches the rate of starch breakdown reported previously, confirming the chloroplast localization of the upstream steps of the glycolytic pathway in Chlamydomonas. Furthermore, the question of the interplay between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic carbon metabolism can be addressed. We show that cyclic electron flow around photosystem I is twice as fast in a starchless mutant fed with acetate than it is in the WT, and we relate how changes in the flux of electrons from carbohydrate metabolism modulate the redox poise of the plastoquinone pool in the dark through chlororespiration',

    authors: 'Fatthy Mohamed Morsy',
    species: 'Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Spirulina platensis',
    summary: 'This work was devoted to separate acetate role in creating anaerobiosis from that of sulfur deprivation. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grown in TAP (Tris–acetate–phosphate) medium was resuspended in sulfur‐replete or ‐deprived medium in sealed or unsealed cultures. Sulfur deprivation was substantial for starch accumulation and hydrogen evolution; however, acetate induced anaerobiosis in the presence or absence of sulfur in only sealed cultures. In non sealed cultures, Chlamydomonas did not lose its photosynthetic activity; however, it was arrested in anoxia with no photosynthetic activity as long as the culture was sealed. The sealed cultures resumed photosynthesis upon unsealing overnight unless the cells died by anoxia at late stage of the experiment. These results indicate that the enhanced oxygen consumption for the enormous acetate respiration and inhibition of the external oxygen supply in sealed cultures of Chlamydomonas are the main reasons for the steady anaerobic conditions. Although acetate was substantial for creating anaerobiosis in Chlamydomonas, sulfur deprivation alone could create anaerobiosis in Spirulina platensis grown autotrophically. Hydrogen evolution and glycogen accumulation were induced under such conditions. Severely reduced phycocyanin, chlorophyll and photosynthesis, while respiration had increased, induced anaerobiosis in Spirulina. This study reports for the first time anaerobiosis under autotrophic conditions in a cyanobacterium.',

    summary: 'The effect of acetate on the oxygen production of the wild type strain CC-1690 - wild type mt+ 21 gr was observed by measuring oxygen levels in culture media containing four different concentrations of sodium acetate: 0mM, 10mM, 20mM, and 30mM. The four treatments were exposed to a light intensity of approximately 2550 lux at 25oC for 1 hour. Differences in initial and final oxygen concentrations and cell densities were measured for three replicates of each treatment. The 0mM medium was found to have the largest oxygen production at 5.6×10⁻⁶± 7.8×10⁻⁷ mg/L/cell, while the 10mM, 20mM, and 30mM treatments were found to have similar oxygen productions at 2.66×10⁻⁶± 6.37×10⁻⁷, 2.70×10⁻⁶± 6.91×10⁻⁷, and 3.30×10⁻⁶± 4.99×10⁻⁷ mg/L/cell respectively. C. reinhardtii used acetate as a carbon source instead of carbon dioxide, the photosynthetic rates in the treatments containing acetate were lowered, resulting in decreased oxygen production levels.',
