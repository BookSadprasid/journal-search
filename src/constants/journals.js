    title: 'A molecular mechanism of chronological aging in yeast',
    authors: 'Burtner',
    species: 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae',
    summary: 'Aging under standard culture conditions is the result of a cell-extrinsic component that is linked to the pH of the culture medium. Identify acetic acid as a cell-extrinsic mediator of cell death during chronological aging, and demonstrate that dietary restriction, growth in a non-fermentable carbon source, or transferring cells to water increases chronological life span by reducing or eliminating extracellular acetic acid. Other life span extending environmental and genetic interventions, such as growth in high osmolarity media, deletion of SCH9 or RAS2, increase cellular resistance to acetic acid.',

    authors: 'Eva Herker',

    summary: 'Chronologically aged yeast cultures die exhibiting typical markers of apoptosis, accumulate oxygen radicals, and show caspase activation. Age-induced cell death is strongly delayed by overexpressing YAP1, a key transcriptional regulator in oxygen stress response. Disruption of apoptosis through deletion of yeast caspase YCA1 initially results in better survival of aged cultures. However, surviving cells lose the ability of regrowth, indicating that pre damaged cells accumulate in the absence of apoptotic cell removal.',

    summary: 'To prove that OPTMs of SirT1 are glutathione (GSH) adducts, glutaredoxin-1 was overexpressed to remove this modification. Glutaredoxin-1 overexpression maintained endogenous SirT1 activity and prevented proapoptotic signaling in metabolically stressed HepG2 cells. The in vivo significance of oxidative inactivation of SirT1 was investigated in livers of high fat diet-fed C57/B6J mice. SirT1 deacetylase activity was decreased in the absence of changes in SirT1 expression and associated with a marked increase in OPTMs. These results indicate that glutathione adducts on specific SirT1 thiols may be responsible for dysfunctional SirT1 associated with liver disease in metabolic syndrome.',

The continuous presence of glucose is not necessary for the induction of growth events, but rather a short \'pulse\' of glucose followed by an incubation period in water will induce growth events. Growth stimulation by glucose occurs in the absence of the SNF3 high affinity glucose transporter growth stimulation occurs independent of carbon source phosphorylation and carbon source metabolism growth induction by carbon source does not require protein synthesis or extracellular calcium. Sixth, following stimulation by carbon source, the cells remain induced for more than 2 h after removal of the carbon source.',

The Pkc1 pathway does not regulate the TOR proteins: transcriptional changes dependent on inhibition of the TORs occur normally in pkc1Delta and mpk1Delta mutants when starved for nitrogen; pkc1Delta and mpk1Delta mutants die rapidly upon treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the TORs. We find that Mpk1 is transiently activated by rapamycin treatment via a novel mechanism. Finally, we find that rapamycin treatment or nitrogen starvation induces resistance to the cell wall-digesting enzyme zymolyase by a Pkc1-dependent mechanism. Thus, the Pkc1 pathway is not a nutrient sensor but acts downstream of TOR inhibition to maintain cell integrity in quiescence.',

Studies in worms and flies point to secondary hormones as mediators of the effect of insulin/ IGF-1 signaling on longevity, whereas studies in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that glucose or insulin/ IGF-1 may decrease longevity by directly down-regulating stress resistance genes. In yeast, longevity mutations postpone superoxide toxicity and mitochondrial damage. However, the small life span extension caused by the overexpression of superoxide dismutases and catalase in yeast and flies indicates that increased antioxidant protection alone cannot be responsible for the major life span extension caused by signal transduction mutations.',

In contrast, the cyr1-2 mutant, which produced a low level of cAMP, constitutively produced three heat shock proteins and four other proteins without the temperature shift and was resistant to the lethal heat treatment. A decrease in the level of cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation results in the heat shock response, including elevated synthesis of three heat shock proteins, acquisition of thermotolerance, and transient arrest of the cell cycle.',

    species: 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae',
    summary: 'By using a mutant unable to synthesize trehalose and glycogen, we have investigated this requirement of trehalose and glycogen under carbon-limited conditions in continuous cultures. Trehalose and glycogen levels increased with decreasing growth rates in the wild-type strain, whereas no trehalose or glycogen was detected in the mutant. However, the mutant was still able to grow and divide at low growth rates with doubling times similar to those for the wild-type strain, indicating that trehalose and glycogen are not essential for cell cycle progression. Nevertheless, upon a slight increase of extracellular carbohydrates, the wild-type strain degraded its reserve carbohydrates and was able to enter a cell division cycle faster than the mutant. In addition, wild-type cells survived much longer than the mutant cells when extracellular carbon was exhausted. Thus, trehalose and glycogen have a dual role under these conditions, serving as storage factors during carbon starvation and providing quickly a higher carbon and ATP flux when conditions improve. Interestingly, the CO2 production rate and hence the ATP flux were higher in the mutant than in the wild-type strain at low growth rates.',
